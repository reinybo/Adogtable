# Adogtable


Adogtable is a website that makes finding adoptable dogs in your area easy! The user simply inputs their zip code and a preferred radius, and Adogtable returns the available dogs within the specified radius! 

Adogtable was created utilizing Java, HTML, CSS, and the RescueGroups API.

I hope to continue working on Adoptable--particularly, I hope to include drop-down menus of dog traits in the side bar which the user can select to filter the results.
