# Adogtable


Adogtable is a website that makes finding adoptable dogs in your area easy! The user simply inputs their zip code and a preferred radius, and Adogtable returns the available dogs within the specified area! After, the user can add filters to the results such as breed or sex. The user can also select the 'Learn more' button on a specific dog to learn more of the dog's attributes and view a link to the adoption page.

### Future Enhancements 

I hope to continue working on Adoptable--particularly, I hope to include more drop-down menus of dog traits in the side bar. I also wish to work out a few kinks with regards to the need to refresh the page for every new search. I also would like the user to be able to select only some filters instead of all.
